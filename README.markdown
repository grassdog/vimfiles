# My Vim Configuration

This configuration has been built up over the years and has drawn inspiration more recently from the following:

* [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope)
* [Steve Losh](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/)
* [The Janus project](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
* [Mislav MarohniÄ‡](https://github.com/mislav/vimfiles)

Plugins are managed via [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) and git submodules.

## Installation

Installation requires `git` and `ruby`.

    git clone https://github.com/grassdog/vimfiles ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    rake setup
