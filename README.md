# My Vim Configuration

This configuration has been built up over the years and has drawn inspiration more recently from the following folks:

* [Tim Pope](https://github.com/tpope)
* [Steve Losh](https://bitbucket.org/sjl/dotfiles/src/tip/vim/)
* [The Janus project](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus)
* [Mislav MarohniÄ‡](https://github.com/mislav/vimfiles)

Plugins are managed via the excellent [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle).

## Installation

Installation requires `git` and `ruby` in your path.

```sh
    $ git clone https://github.com/grassdog/vimfiles
    $ cd vimfiles
    $ rake setup
```
